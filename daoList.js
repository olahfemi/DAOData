Parachains are connected to Polkadot's central Relay Chain, and benefit from its security and stacks. Blockchains that are not parachains can connect to the Polkadot network via Bridges. 
        
        Polkadot governance focuses on broad, protocol-level changes to the system, rather than specific internal ones. Relying on Substrate governance modules, decisions are approved by a stake-weighted voting event called a Referenda. Proposals may be from the public or made by the Council- an on-chain elected body that also manages the treasury and holds the power to halt harmful proposals.",
